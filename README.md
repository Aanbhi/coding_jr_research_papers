LLM Chatbot – Project Tasks and Implementation Guide

Overview

This project outlines the multi-stage development of an advanced LLM-based chatbot. The system evolves incrementally, with each stage adding new capabilities. The final goal is a production-ready, efficient, and intelligent chatbot that can analyze attachments, retrieve contextual knowledge, call external tools, and optimize its own responses.

Project Stages

Task 1 – Basic Chatbot Deployment using Docker

Goal: Deploy a simple LLM chatbot inside a Docker container for easy portability and scalability.

Steps:

Set up FastAPI/Flask backend.

Containerize the chatbot with Docker.

Test deployment locally and prepare for cloud deployment.

Task 2 – Attachment Analysis Capability

Goal: Extend chatbot to accept and analyze attachments (PDFs, images, text files).

Steps:

Implement /upload endpoint.

Use PyMuPDF for PDFs, Tesseract OCR for images, and plain-text parsers.

Integrate extraction pipeline with the chatbot.

Task 3 – Vector Embedding and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Goal: Enable the chatbot to provide context-aware responses using embeddings and retrieval.

Steps:

Extract and chunk text from uploaded files.

Generate embeddings (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace).

Store embeddings in a vector database (FAISS / Chroma / Milvus).

On query: retrieve relevant chunks → feed into LLM → generate response.

Task 4 – Agentic AI Integration

Goal: Enhance chatbot with autonomous decision-making and dynamic reasoning.

Steps:

Integrate agent frameworks like LangChain Agents.

Allow the chatbot to decide when to query documents, call APIs, or use tools.

Implement reasoning chain to justify actions.

Task 5 – Function-Calling Framework and External Tools

Goal: Allow chatbot to trigger external tools for advanced tasks.

Steps:

Implement function-calling architecture.

Integrate at least three tools:

Web Search & Retrieval

Code Snippet Runner (sandboxed)

Data Formatter/Converter

Enable multi-step tool chaining for complex queries.

Task 6 – Answer Consistency Check

Goal: Ensure chatbot’s responses are reliable and self-consistent.

Steps:

Implement answer verification pipeline:

Re-check answers with alternative prompts.

Compare retrieved context with generated answer.

Use self-reflection loop (LLM verifies its own output).

Provide confidence score for responses.

Task 7 – LLM Deployment Efficiency Optimization

Goal: Research and implement methods to reduce latency, optimize token usage, and minimize costs in production.

Techniques to Explore:

Caching:
Cache embeddings, retrieval results, and frequent LLM outputs.

Prompt Optimization:
Shorten prompts with context distillation.

Use structured prompts instead of long instructions.

Batching & Parallelization:
Batch queries for embeddings.

Run parallel API calls where possible.

Hybrid Models:
Use smaller local models for lightweight tasks, large LLMs only when necessary.

Streaming Responses:
Enable partial token streaming for faster UX.

Cost Optimization:
Limit max token usage.

Fine-tune smaller models for domain-specific queries.

Answer consistency verification

Optimized efficiency for deployment
