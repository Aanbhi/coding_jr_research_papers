LLM Chatbot – Project Tasks and Implementation Guide


Overview

This project outlines the multi-stage development of an advanced LLM-based chatbot. The system evolves incrementally, with each stage adding new capabilities. The final goal is a production-ready, efficient, and intelligent chatbot that can analyze attachments, retrieve contextual knowledge, call external tools, and optimize its own responses.

Project Stages

Task 1 – Basic Chatbot Deployment using Docker

Goal:
Deploy a simple LLM chatbot inside a Docker container for easy portability and scalability.

Steps:

1. Set up FastAPI/Flask backend.

2. Containerize the chatbot with Docker.

3. Test deployment locally and prepare for cloud deployment.

Task 2 – Attachment Analysis Capability

Goal:
Extend chatbot to accept and analyze attachments (PDFs, images, text files).

Steps:

1. Implement /upload endpoint.

2. Use PyMuPDF for PDFs, Tesseract OCR for images, and plain-text parsers.

3. Integrate extraction pipeline with the chatbot.

Task 3 – Vector Embedding and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Goal:
Enable the chatbot to provide context-aware responses using embeddings and retrieval.

Steps:

1. Extract and chunk text from uploaded files.

2. Generate embeddings (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace).

3. Store embeddings in a vector database (FAISS / Chroma / Milvus).

4. On query: retrieve relevant chunks → feed into LLM → generate response.

Task 4 – Agentic AI Integration

Goal:
Enhance chatbot with autonomous decision-making and dynamic reasoning.

Steps:

1. Integrate agent frameworks like LangChain Agents.

2. Allow the chatbot to decide when to query documents, call APIs, or use tools.

3. Implement reasoning chain to justify actions.

Task 5 – Function-Calling Framework and External Tools

Goal:
Allow chatbot to trigger external tools for advanced tasks.

Steps:

1. Implement function-calling architecture.

2. Integrate at least three tools:

3. Web Search & Retrieval

4. Code Snippet Runner (sandboxed)

5. Data Formatter/Converter

6. Enable multi-step tool chaining for complex queries.

Task 6 – Answer Consistency Check

Goal:
Ensure chatbot’s responses are reliable and self-consistent.

Steps:

1. Implement answer verification pipeline:

2. Re-check answers with alternative prompts.

3. Compare retrieved context with generated answer.

4. Use self-reflection loop (LLM verifies its own output).

5. Provide confidence score for responses.

Task 7 – LLM Deployment Efficiency Optimization

Goal:
Research and implement methods to reduce latency, optimize token usage, and minimize costs in production.

Techniques to Explore:

1. Caching:

Cache embeddings, retrieval results, and frequent LLM outputs.

2. Prompt Optimization:

Shorten prompts with context distillation.

Use structured prompts instead of long instructions.

3. Batching & Parallelization:

Batch queries for embeddings.

Run parallel API calls where possible.

4. Hybrid Models:

Use smaller local models for lightweight tasks, large LLMs only when necessary.

5. Streaming Responses:

Enable partial token streaming for faster UX.

6. Cost Optimization:

Limit max token usage.

Fine-tune smaller models for domain-specific queries.
